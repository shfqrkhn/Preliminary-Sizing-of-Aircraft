# Preliminary-Sizing-of-Aircraft
Based on Roskam and Raymer textbooks


I used my prior C++ knowledge to create a Java program with simple GUI using Netbeans IDE. It performed preliminary sizing for the SAR Aircraft for my NCADE Capstone 2016-2017 project. The whole project took me only 40 manhours, which included going through the relevant theories in Roskam & Raymer textbooks, Java tutorials, familiarization with the IDE environment, and the actual coding.
